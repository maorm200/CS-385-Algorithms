# CS-385-Algorithms
Coursework from CS-385

Course Overview:

CS 385 is a course on the design and analysis of algorithms.  
It covers asymptotic complexity analysis, space‐time tradeoffs, standard algorithm design techniques, 
and classic algorithms that serve as examples of design techniques.  This course also develops C++ 
language programming skills by implementing graph algorithms, numerical algorithms, complex search and sort algorithms, 
and solutions to optimization problems. TopicsCoveredCourse introduction Important problem types Review of fundamental 
data structures Introduction to C++ development Analysis framework; big‐O, Theta, Omega Analysis of non‐recursive 
algorithms Analysis of recursive algorithms Master theorem Brute force algorithms Exhaustive search Divide and 
conquer algorithms; review mergesort, quicksort, binary search Decrease and conquer algorithms; DFS, BFS, and 
topological sorting Transform and conquer algorithms 
Space‐time tradeoffs Dynamic programming Greedy techniques Iterative algorithms
